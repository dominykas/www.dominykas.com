		<description>Although I wouldn&#039;t call myself a fan of Nielsen and/or his rating concepts, that it irrelevant. But you know how it is, we humans love to insert our 5 cents, because everyone else really wants to hear it.

I completely agree with this phrase: “well designed mobile specific sites”... in my side of the globe (S. Africa), Blackberry&#039;s are extremely popular, and continue to thrive. Many people either use a Blackberry only, or as a &#039;second phone&#039;. 
I&#039;m one of the latter, I find it unparalleled when it comes to email push functionality, always-on IM (I can&#039;t think of another IM like BBM, which cannot be switched off completely - without some hacking). 
Also, as an e-book reader (I collect them as pdf&#039;s), and for light browsing-in-bed, again... champion. Pity about the OS6 and 7 loaded Curves. They have the nifty Webkit browser, but it&#039;s only good at crashing - it does that like a BOSS.  On the Torch&#039;s and Bolds too, but they have more RAM and all that fancy stuff.

I haven&#039;t really had an OS10 phone long enough to abuse it yet, but it doesn&#039;t matter. I was getting to the following: most people have (it is indeed probable, but let&#039;s assume it true) OS 4, 5, 6 and 7 starter to mid-range Blackberrys, or an S60/Symbian, Windows 6.5 or lower and there are plenty of J2ME phones around.

I have not mentioned the Androids, iOS&#039;s because I&#039;m thinking backwards compatibility here. It is possible to create a solid mobile webapp that looks great on anything from the aforementioned pieces of crap right up to an HD widescreen LCD monitor... two examples come to mind: m.box.net and the mobile facebook.

And you know what? I just realised that although I don&#039;t use Facebook on my PC much anymore, I almost always go straight to it when I do browse the web with my phone.</description>
