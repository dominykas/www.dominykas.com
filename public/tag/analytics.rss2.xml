			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have recently moved my dedicated server to a new provider. I mostly did this for pricing reasons, but there&#8217;s also the benefit of network speed, as most of my visitors and now &#8211; the server itself &#8211; are in Europe. This move, coupled with a few optimizations, has opened my eyes towards some data &#8211; the impact of page load time on &#8220;pages per visit&#8221; metric. While the general theory behind the relationship of the two is clear to everyone, the actual numbers did shock me.</p>
<p>There is a small community that I am hosting &#8211; it has roughly 2000 members, who are pretty active. As the community does not accept any new members, the results reflect just the <strong>engagement based on page load speed</strong>. I did not really take measurements, and <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">Webmaster Central</a> page speed lab tool is unable to provide the numbers due to the closed nature of the community, I estimate that the average full page <strong>load time decreased from some 8-12s to 3-5s</strong>. The effect on <strong>pageviews? PLUS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT</strong>. There is no change in the number of visits (sessions), but the number of pageviews is up by a third <strong>instantly</strong>. Check out the graph:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.dominykas.com/uploads/2010/04/page-speed-improves-ppv.png"><img src="http://www.dominykas.com/uploads/2010/04/page-speed-improves-ppv-300x72.png" alt="" title="page-speed-improves-ppv" width="300" height="72" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-83"/></a></p>
<p>There is one more statistically significant website that I had a chance to test. This time, the page load time decreased from 5s to 1.5s. Yet again &#8211; the pages per visit number is up by 12%. Now, here&#8217;s the best part of it all &#8211; the two websites are somewhat related (you may call them &#8220;affiliates&#8221; if you&#8217;d like). Since both of them had substantial speed improvements &#8211; the referral rate from one to the other has actually increased&#8230; <strong>threefold</strong>.</p>
<p>While I must say, that the actual time on site has not increased as much, the pageview count is what matters a lot if you&#8217;re participating in <abbr title="Pay per click">PPC</abbr>. Funny thing, is that if you <em>are</em> actually participating in <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2010/03/29/p3pc-google-adsense/">Google AdSense &#8211; that will be the bottleneck</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the day &#8211; the overall user experience improvement is quite immeasurable and the pleasure of having your visitors tell you &#8220;wow this is fast&#8221; is indescribable.</p>
<p>Worried about premature optimization? Well, it still holds true that you should only optimize where it hurts.</p>
