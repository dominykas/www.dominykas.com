			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two days ago Jakob Nielsen published a new Alertbox column: <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/mobile-vs-full-sites.html">Mobile Site vs. Full Site</a>, which seems to have caused some uproar in the web community, <a href="https://twitter.com/karenmcgrane/status/189816427795062784">openly mocking his ideas</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jakob Nielsen&#8217;s April Fools Day piece on mobile is HILARIOUS. So boneheadedly wrong. But why April 10? (<a href="https://twitter.com/karenmcgrane">@karenmcgrane</a>)</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#8217;m not sure I see the contradiction between what Nielsen says and Responsive Design. He&#8217;s just stating that &#8220;well designed mobile specific sites&#8221; work better for the users. Is there anything to argue about that?</p>
<p>Now, some are trying to say, that <a href="http://www.lucentwebdesign.co.uk/index.php/blog/entry/on_not_quite_agreeing_with_jakob_nielsen">this is also pushing the expensive option</a>. But how is that a problem? If you can&#8217;t afford it &#8211; well, you don&#8217;t have it! And Responsive Web Design is the cheaper option, even if not as optimal as a completely separate site.</p>
<p>IMHO, RWD is purely a technical solution to achieve the same result &#8211; optimize the layout and content for mobile. It&#8217;s not like Nielsen is saying &#8220;Don&#8217;t use CSS &#8211; use font tags and tables for layout&#8221;.  And that&#8217;s what media queries really are &#8211; just a simpler technical way of using different CSS for the same markup.</p>
<p>From the designers perspective (as in &#8220;graphical bit&#8221;) <strong>RWD is still about making multiple designs</strong> (especially if done in Photoshop). RWD only places an additional constraint &#8211; the content must be pretty much the same. However, the &#8220;design&#8221; itself, while consistent, is still different. IMHO RWD is more similar to Nielsen&#8217;s &#8220;two sites&#8221; idea, than different.</p>
<p>The only place where Nielsen is more wrong than not in that article is about the &#8220;<..> penalty imposed on desktop users when you give them a design that&#8217;s suboptimal for bigger screens&#8221; &#8211; but I believe that&#8217;s just the mis-interpretation of &#8220;mobile first&#8221;, because &#8220;mobile first&#8221; is not &#8220;mobile only&#8221;. Neither is responsive design.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Jakob Nielsen <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/interviews/nielsen-responds-mobile-criticism">responded to critique</a>. I find this bit to be saying exactly what I tried to say with this post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are at least three different ways of implementing different user interfaces for different devices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each version lives at a different URL.</li>
<li>The same URL serves up different versions, depending on the device used to request the page.</li>
<li>The same code is transmitted to all devices, and the client side transforms this into the different designs, using responsive design.</li>
</ol>
<p>As long as each user sees the appropriate design, the choice between these implementation options should be an engineering decision and not a usability decision.</p>
