			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a sample of how your &#8220;it&#8217;s easy&#8221; and my &#8220;sure, probably half an hour&#8221; becomes &#8220;half a day&#8221;:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>You want me to make the Thing clickable?</li>
<li>Is just the Thing clickable or the whole line?
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">Just the Thing &#8211; introduces technicalities (below)</li>
<li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">Whole line &#8211; quirky on small screens in portrait</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>When you move your mouse over &#8211; how does it change to indicate it is clickable?</li>
<li>How shall we give it an affordance (make it look clickable)?
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">The heading nearby is the same color as our standard link color. If we are to use our standard link color for the Thing, we must make all headings dark blue, which results in disbalance.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">Add an icon &#8211; we&#8217;ll introduce clutter, plus the icon is not always visible on smaller screens, let alone it&#8217;s harder to implement</li>
<li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">We can reduce icon clutter by increasing line height, but then Other Things no longer align and the Whole Thing looks disbalanced</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Thing sometimes displays in gray. How do we make THAT Thing clickable?</li>
<li>Oh, and we&#8217;ll need to test pretty much every variation on PC, iPhone and Android and then when finally happy-ish &#8211; double check on all Internet Explorers.</li>
</ol>
<p>All this just to make one thing clickable, that wasn&#8217;t ever really meant to be clickable.</p>
<p>Ah, here&#8217;s another one:</p>
<ol start="-1">
<li>Let&#8217;s have a chat facility&#8230;</li>
<li>Let&#8217;s show user&#8217;s online status&#8230;</li>
<li>How do we know they are logged in?</li>
<li>What if they have the chat open multiple tabs?</li>
<li>What if they log out in one of these tabs?</li>
<li>Oh, let&#8217;s just see when they last loaded the page?</li>
<li>What if they leave a tab open for 30 minutes, but don&#8217;t do anything?</li>
<li>What if they have us as their homepage, therefore they visit often, but usually don&#8217;t even look at the chat?</li>
<li>What if they go to another tab and browse Facebook?</li>
<li>What if they have two tabs and go to another tab and don&#8217;t browse Facebook?</li>
<li>What if they leave the page open and go home?</li>
<li>What if they leave the chat open and go to the toilet for 30 minutes and then spend 30 minutes in Excel?</li>
</ol>
<p>Oh, so we should have a state where they are &#8220;online&#8221;, but &#8220;idle&#8221;? Congratulations, you just doubled the complexity.</p>
<p>Some changes are easier. Some are even trickier. I can&#8217;t recall the last time I said &#8220;sure, it&#8217;s trivial&#8221;, and it really was&#8230;</p>
<p>☑ Write a blog post this year.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Positive start: my new Dell XPS 8100 is now ready for work. To achieve that I had to overcome a couple of puzzlers. They were mostly related to my weird requirements, which I guess are not the common set up path&#8230;</p>
<h2>The weird setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>The choice of desktop OS is sort of trivial &#8211; Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx. The reasoning is simple &#8211; 99% of things just work and I&#8217;m quite familiar with it. The active community plays a large part too.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> as the main virtualizer. I&#8217;m already a bit familiar with it, and I like its small footprint and the fact that it is easy to setup. I also made a stupid mistake of activating my Windows 7 inside of it, before trying out other VM software. At the end of the day &#8211; with guest additions installed, it is absolutely amazing and I have no problems there. Seriously &#8211; <a href="http://twitter.com/dymonaz/status/13877378744">I can watch YouTube inside Win7 inside a VM</a> practically without glitches!</li>
<li><a href="http://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page">Proxmox Virtual Environment</a> inside the aforementioned Virtualbox. Now, some might say I&#8217;m crazy to run a VM inside a VM, but using <a href="http://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Container_and_Full_Virtualization">containers is far more efficient</a> (especially due to low RAM usage) than running real VMs. Considering OpenVZ was not included in Lucid, and LXC is by far not ready (read: I don&#8217;t have enough time to learn everything without proper documentation), Proxmox was an easy choice to make. I&#8217;m already using it in production and I&#8217;m really happy with how easy it is to setup and maintain.</li>
<li>Ubuntu Lucid again, to host services (Apache, MySQL, couchdb, etc) inside OpenVZ containers. I absolutely love the <a href="http://wiki.openvz.org/Download/template/precreated">minimal OpenVZ templates</a>. The only reason I&#8217;m not going for Debian here is the fact that the releases don&#8217;t happen frequently enough for my liking. I may reconsider this down the road &#8211; but for now &#8211; Ubuntu works out for me better.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problem 1. Proxmox didn&#8217;t like being inside VirtualBox</h2>
<p>I downloaded the &#8220;bare metal installer&#8221; and tried to start it in a VM. All went well until the first reboot, and then it would just hang after detecting the (virtual) hard disks. Took me a couple of hours of scratching my head, until I installed pure Debian inside VirtualBox. Strangely, during installation, the hard drive was appearing as <code>hda</code>, but after finishing, would all of a sudden change to <code>sda</code>, which obviously made things go really sour.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> change the IDE controller (VM properties -&gt; Storage) from the default PIIX4 to ICH6. I have no clue what all of this means, but the resulting VM now boots fine.</p>
<h2>Problem 2. <code>fsck</code> during every boot due to &#8220;last mount time in the future&#8221;</h2>
<p>This one is simple &#8211; the VM has no access to the hardware clock, which by default is expected to be set to UTC, so your true time gets double-adjusted (once in the host, once in the guest). To fix edit <code>/etc/default/rcS</code> and <a href="http://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&#038;t=27334">make sure <code>UTC=no</code></a>.</p>
<h2>Problem 3. MySQL won&#8217;t start inside Lucid inside OpenVZ</h2>
<p>Considering that Lucid doesn&#8217;t really support being the host, or the guest of OpenVZ, this comes as no surprise and the bug is marked as &#8220;<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mysql-dfsg-5.1/+bug/566736">Won&#8217;t fix</a>&#8220;. Luckily, there&#8217;s a smart guy, <a href="http://blog.bodhizazen.net/linux/ubuntu-10-04-openvz-templates/">who has a workaround</a>. Solution: edit <code>/etc/init/mysql.conf</code> to have it <code>start on runlevel [2345]</code>, instead of the default method, which depends on networking.</p>
<p>I think, I now have all the ingredients to start working on the <em>???</em> part!</p>
