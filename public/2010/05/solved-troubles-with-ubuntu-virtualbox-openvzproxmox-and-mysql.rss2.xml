		<description>Interesting. I thought I was the first one to have this idea. To good this is that at least I know now that what I was doing is not that crazy at all. I also have Windows 7 and Proxmox running on VirtualBox. It works flawlessly and take far less resources when using ONLY OpenVZ containers.

I have an annoyance that I am experiencing though ... My home network is using 192.168.2.x ... and Proxmox is using 192.168.2.15 (static IP configured inside Proxmox)

Unfortunately, as soon as I am on another network, the IP 192.168.2.15 will be unavailable. Maybe it&#039;s just a matter of create an alias for the interface and use that IP instead of the one that matches the current network.

Cheers.</description>

		<description>The strange thing is your weird setup actually makes perfect sense to me, at least for setting up testing appliances.  I was thinking of doing a sipwitch testing appliance and a backup/test site for my main public site, which uses mediawiki, and maybe something for something else.  None of these really require a full vm by themselves (which seems a huge waste of resources), I did not wish to mix them together in testing, nor did I wish to dedicate a box just for things that have rather transient use.  Disk space and memory I do have plenty of on my main dev box, I too have become rather familiar with virtualbox, and I also like it&#039;s small footprint and simplicity.

It&#039;s possible with the newer kernel in proxmox 1.6 (it now uses 2.6.32) will remap /dev/sda correctly from first boot, though I think I may try the virtualbox sata if it has better performance.</description>
