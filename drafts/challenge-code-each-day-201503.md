# Code each day, every day challenge

Working for a startup, with a high focus on business, might take the joy out of programming. Some people know this loss 
of joy as "burnout". Due to a reasonably tough December and no cool off in sight (that's what startups do - they build 
build build - and never stop [until they actually stop]) I started sensing that I'm enjoying coding less and less. For 
me that would be a big problem! And I needed to get the spark back.

How does one start enjoying coding? My answer is that you need to code up the things that you love. You need to code for 
fun. You need to code for exploration. You need to code without pressure. You need to code without delivering the 
mythical "business value". Admittedly, there's people who enjoy pain, but that's not me. I'm lazy and I like my 
pleasures and I like my fun.

A lot of people are taking up open source, drones, whatever other coding things they do. There's CodeRetreats with the 
philosophy of enjoying the perfection of code. I felt that my non-enjoyment of coding was getting so bad, that one off 
events wouldn't cut it. I felt that I needed to have at least some fun coding every day - you know, just like brushing 
teeth.

And that's why I started coding each day, every day. My challenge is to have a public green tick on GitHub every day. 
A much bigger challenge, though, is to make sure that it's 
<a href="blog.intercom.io/meaningful-growth-vs-metric-manipulation/">a meaningful metric</a>. An even bigger challenge 
is to actually stop coding, when you're having fun! I did not want to lose my sleep and family for this.

notes:

* midnight and being true to self
* last minute commits with 0% battery
* let go (e.g. jsdom3 can wait until tomorrow)
* small chunks
* if I can do it in an hour, it's probably worth doing only if it's automating the stuff to be done, instead of actual doing
